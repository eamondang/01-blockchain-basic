* What is Blockchain?
+ High Availability
+ Sustainability
+ Irreversibility
+ Transparency
+ Append-only
+ =Consensus=
+ Security
+ Global

* Types of Blockchain
+ Permissionless Blockchain - Public Blockchain
  + Anyone can access to write the data
  + Anyone can read
  + Ex: 99%
+ Permissioned Blockchain - Private Blockchain
  + Participants need permission to accessing the data
  + Readers need permission to read
  + Ex: [[https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric][Hyperledger Fabric]], [[https://r3.com/][Corda]]
+ Consortium Blockchain
  + Participants need permission to accessing the data
  + Anyone can read
  + Ex: [[https://ripple.com/][Ripple]]

* New generation Blockchain
+ It can be thought of as =ONE BIG COMPUTER= made up of small computers around the world.
+ All these computers (nodes) are connected to one another and have a full copy of the code and data.
+ One of the best ways to understand Ethereum is by comparing it with a =traditional client/server architecture=

* Decentralized Features
** Level of Decentralization
** Security
+ Single Failure Tolerance *(Consensus)*
+ Availability
+ Sybil Attacks
+ 51% Attacks
** Performance
+ Communicate - Broadcast Data
+ Argreement among Participants
